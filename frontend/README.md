# Frontend Developer Test

## Project
Build a small web app using the Movie Database API (https://developers.themoviedb.org).
 
### Minimum viable product
When first loaded, the user should see a list of the most popular movies (see https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies/get-popular-movies).
A user can click on any movie in the list and view more details for the movie.

### Requirements
This app should query the Movie DB API and return the results to the user.
Develop your UI using your frontend technologies of choice.
UX Polish. This is not a design exercise, but your app should demonstrate mastery of your frontend toolset.
Include a README.md with step-by-step instructions for running the app.
